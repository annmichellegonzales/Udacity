# 3. Keep score
# The starter Game class does not keep score. It doesn't even notice which player won each round. Update the Game class so that it displays the outcome of each round, and keeps score for both players. You can use the provided beats function, which tells whether one move beats another one.

# Make sure to handle ties â€” when both players make the same move!
